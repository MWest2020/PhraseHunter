# PhraseHunter
Classic game that makes you hunt for a phrase in 5 turns or less!

## General Info

The aim for this little game is just having some fun and to work with classes in JavaScript. The HTML and CSS were 
provided by Treehouse - this was the 4th project from the Full-Stack course.

I altered the CSS a bit to give it a more polished look. 

the changes are the icons on every screen, as well as the alteration of the start and game background.

## Technologies

* HTML 5   
* CSS 3
* JavaScript ES6 


The game is started by downloading all the files and by running the index.html file. Any modern browser should do. Internet Explorer 
does not support arrow functions though.

### Note:

Future update may include more phrases, phrase input and animations.
